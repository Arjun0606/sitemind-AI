## For Customers & Sales

## What is SiteMind?

**SiteMind is a smart assistant that lives inside your WhatsApp and turns your project conversations into organized, searchable, traceable records.**

Your team already uses WhatsApp for everything. SiteMind just makes it intelligent.

---

## The Problem We Solve

| Current Reality | Cost |
|-----------------|------|
| Decisions made on phone calls - no record | ₹3-10L in disputes |
| Important drawings buried in WhatsApp | ₹5-15L in rework |
| "Who approved this?" - Nobody knows | ₹2-5L in blame games |
| RFIs pending for days - nobody tracking | ₹2-5L in delays |
| Management has no visibility | Decisions made too late |

**Total: ₹15-40 lakh lost per month per project**

## How SiteMind Works

```
YOUR TEAM                           SITEMIND
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Uses WhatsApp normally          →   Reads & understands
                                    every message

Shares drawings                 →   Stores & indexes
                                    with version tracking

Makes decisions on calls        →   Logs when you tell it
                                    "Decision: xyz approved"

Asks questions                  →   Answers instantly
                                    with source citation

Goes about their day            →   Sends daily summary
                                    to management
```

**Zero new apps. Zero training. Zero behavior change.**

          📋 Revision: R3
          📄 Page: 14

---

### 2️⃣ DRAWING VERSION CONTROL

**What it does:**
Every drawing shared is tracked with version, date, and who uploaded it.

**Example:**
```
You share: STR-07.pdf

SiteMind: "📐 Drawing Received: STR-07

          ⚠️ NOTE: This is Revision R1
          A newer version exists:
          - Revision R3 uploaded 5 days ago
          - Changes: Column C3 size updated

```

**Value:** Never use the wrong drawing again.

---

### 3️⃣ DECISION LOGGING

**What it does:**
Log any decision - from phone calls, meetings, or messages - with full traceability.

**Example:**
```
You: "Decision: Client approved vitrified tiles 
      instead of ceramic - extra ₹4.2L"

SiteMind: "✅ Decision Logged
          
          Client approved vitrified tiles 
          instead of ceramic - extra ₹4.2L

```

**Value:** Complete audit trail. Proof for every approval.

---

### 4️⃣ RFI TRACKING

**What it does:**
Track all clarifications/questions that need response. Auto-remind until resolved.

          Question: Handrail height clarification
          Raised by: Site Engineer Arun
          Assigned to: Architect
          Status: 🔴 OPEN
          
          I will remind until this is resolved."
```

**3 days later, if no response:**
```
SiteMind: "⏰ REMINDER
          
          RFI-2024-0045 is pending for 3 days
          Handrail height clarification
          
          @Architect - please respond"
```
