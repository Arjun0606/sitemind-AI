---

## Day 0: Before The Call

### Prepare
- [ ] Supabase set up & tested
- [ ] Twilio WhatsApp configured
- [ ] Test query works (IS code question)
- [ ] Test photo analysis works

### Your Message to Friend

Bhai, I built something for construction sites.
AI assistant on WhatsApp.
Want to try it free for a month?
30 min call to set up.
```

---

## Day 1: Onboarding Call (30 min)

### 1. Context (5 min)
```
"What's your biggest frustration on site?
- Engineers calling you for specs?
- Waiting for architect responses?
- Remembering past decisions?"
```

### 2. Setup (10 min)
- Create company in admin
- Add 2-3 site engineers (phone numbers)
- Choose one active project

### 3. First WOW (15 min)

**Do this IN FRONT of them:**

1. **Ask a technical question:**
   ```
   "What's the minimum cover for RCC columns 
   as per IS 456?"
   ```
   👉 AI answers in 10 seconds with IS code reference

2. **Send a photo:**
   - Take a random construction photo from Google
   - Send it
   👉 AI analyzes quality, materials, issues

3. **Memory test:**
   - Ask a question
   - Wait 5 minutes
   - Ask a follow-up
   👉 AI remembers context!

### 4. Handoff
```
"That's it. Your team can use this 24/7.
Every question, every photo - just WhatsApp.
I'll check in tomorrow."
```

---

## Day 2-3: Check-In

### Morning Message (Send at 8 AM)
```
Good morning! How's SiteMind working?

Quick tip: Send site photos for instant 
quality analysis. Just click and send!
```

### If They're Not Using It
```
"Any questions from site today?
Try asking SiteMind - let me know if it helps!"
```

### If They ARE Using It
```
"Nice! You've asked X questions today.
That's Y hours saved already. 
Keep going!"
```

---

## Day 4-5: Memory Flex

### The Play
```
"Remember when you asked about 
column spacing last week?"

[Ask a related question]

👉 AI recalls the previous conversation
👉 "Holy shit it remembers everything"
```

### If Safety Issue Found
```
🚨 SiteMind flagged a potential issue
in that photo you sent.

This is why having AI check everything
helps - catches things before they
become expensive.
```
