## ✅ Things We CAN Actually Do (100% Reliable)

### 1. Remember Everything Anyone Says
- User types "Column C1 is 450x450mm" → We remember forever
- User types "Client approved marble" → We remember with timestamp
- User types "Spoke to architect about handrail" → We remember

### 2. Store & Retrieve Files
- User uploads PDF → We store it with metadata
- User asks "send latest structural" → We send the file
- User asks "what versions of STR-07 exist" → We list them

### 3. Track Versions by Filename
- STR-07-R1.pdf uploaded 1-Dec
- STR-07-R2.pdf uploaded 10-Dec ← We know this is newer
- User mentions "R1" → We warn them R2 exists

### 4. Detect Intent from Text (AI)
- "Client approved the tiles" → AI detects: DECISION
- "Leakage in unit 1204" → AI detects: ISSUE
- "Need consultant input on handrail" → AI detects: RFI
- "Slab casting done floor 7" → AI detects: PROGRESS

### 5. Search & Answer from Stored Data
- "Who approved tile change?" → Search memory → Find decision → Answer
- "What did architect say?" → Search memory → Find conversation → Answer
- "Show all waterproofing issues" → Search memory → List results

### 6. Generate Summaries (AI)
- "Give me today's summary" → AI reads all today's messages → Generates summary
- "Weekly report" → AI reads week's data → Generates report

### 7. Track RFIs
- AI detects RFI → Creates entry → Tracks status
- "What RFIs are pending?" → Lists open RFIs
- "RFI-001 answered" → Updates status

### 8. Track Issues
- AI detects issue → Logs with severity
- "What issues are open?" → Lists them
- Pattern detection: "3 similar leaks in same stack"

### 9. Basic Predictions (from Text Patterns)
- Lots of "waiting for material" messages → Flag material risk
- Many "labour shortage" mentions → Flag delay risk
- Multiple issues with same contractor → Flag contractor concern

## ❌ Things We CANNOT Do (Don't Promise)

### 1. Read Drawings Visually
- Cannot look at a PDF image and read "450x450mm"
- Cannot extract specs from drawing unless it's searchable text
- Cannot compare two drawings and find visual differences

### 2. Extract Text from Scanned PDFs
- Most construction drawings are images inside PDFs
- We store them, we can't read what's in them

### 3. Automatic Spec Extraction
- Cannot auto-populate "Column C1 = 450mm" from drawing
- Only know what users TELL us or what was in RFI responses

### 4. Photo Analysis
- Cannot look at site photo and detect issues
- Cannot compare photo to drawing
- We store photos with captions, that's it

### 5. Integrations with Other Software
- No Primavera/MS Project sync
- No SAP integration
- No automatic import from anywhere

## The Pitch (Honest Version)

> "SiteMind turns your WhatsApp into a project brain. Everything anyone says - decisions, approvals, issues, progress - is automatically captured, organized, and made searchable. No more digging through 500 messages. No more 'who approved this?' disputes. No more wrong drawing versions. Just ask SiteMind."

**NOT:**
> "SiteMind reads your drawings and tells you specs" ← We can't do this

---

## Pricing Justification

At $1000/month, we save:
- 20+ hours/month searching for info = ₹50,000+ in time
- 1 prevented "who approved?" dispute = ₹3-10 lakhs
- 1 prevented wrong drawing incident = ₹5-15 lakhs
- Peace of mind that everything is documented

**ROI: 10-50x the cost**
