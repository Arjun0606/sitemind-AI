## 🧨 The Real Problem

Large projects lose **₹20-80 lakh/month** because:

- Latest drawings don't reach site
- Decisions get buried in WhatsApp
- No single record of who approved what
- RFIs vanish or stay unanswered
- Contractors blame each other
- Rework happens because specs weren't checked
- Management gets problems too late

**This isn't a "mistake problem."**
**It's a traceability + coordination problem.**

## SiteMind: A Senior Project Engineer Inside WhatsApp

Instead of another app your team won't use,
SiteMind lives where your site team already works — **WhatsApp**.

It captures drawings, RFIs, photos, conversations, decisions
and turns them into **clean, structured, traceable project intelligence**.

---

## What SiteMind Does (No Hype. Real Value.)

### 1. Latest Drawing Verification

Send any drawing → SiteMind tells you:
- Latest revision
- What changed
- Conflicts with other sheets
- Where it came from

```
"STR-07 (R3) is outdated.
R4 uploaded 2 days ago.
Changes: Column C3 size updated to 500x500."
```

### 2. Instant Answers With Exact Citations

Ask: *"What is the column size at grid B2?"*

SiteMind replies:
```
450x450mm
From STR-05, Rev R2, Page 14
```

**No hallucinations.**
Everything backed by actual drawings you uploaded.

### 3. Full RFI Tracking

SiteMind auto-tracks:
- Raised RFIs
- Pending RFIs
- Who needs to respond
- Approvals
- Delayed RFIs

Nothing slips. No follow-up chaos.

### 4. WhatsApp → Clean Daily Logs

Your messy WhatsApp groups become:
- Today's issues
- Decisions made
- Approvals pending
- Risks for tomorrow
- Contractor delays
- Material shortage warnings

### 5. Project Memory

Every drawing, message, update, decision stays connected.

In 6 months when someone asks:
*"Who approved this change and when?"*

SiteMind answers in **2 seconds** with proof.

### 6. Management Dashboard

Live visibility across the project:
- Drawing revisions
- Decision logs
- RFI delays
- Contractor performance
- Daily summaries
- Issues by tower/area
- Timeline of events

## What SiteMind DOES NOT Do (On Purpose)

To avoid overpromising & maximize reliability:

❌ No "auto detect rebar size from photo" claims
❌ No "AI replaces QA" nonsense
❌ No hallucinations
❌ No magical automation we can't guarantee
❌ No app that forces site teams to learn something new

**We stay laser-focused on accuracy, traceability, and control — not sci-fi.**

|------|------|
| One missed revision | ₹5-8 lakh loss |
| One wrong approval | ₹3-5 lakh impact |
| One delayed RFI | 2-5 day schedule slip |
