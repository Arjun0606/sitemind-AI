# SiteMind: 1-Week Sprint to FINAL Product
## Target: $400k/month by June 2025

---

## 🎯 THE MATH

```
$400,000/month ÷ $10,000/customer = 40 whale customers

TIMELINE:
December 2024: Build + Launch (Week 1)
January 2025:  5 customers ($50k)
February 2025: 10 customers ($100k)
March 2025:    20 customers ($200k)
April 2025:    30 customers ($300k)
May 2025:      35 customers ($350k)
June 2025:     40 customers ($400k)

Growth rate: ~5 new whales/month
That's 1-2 new customers per week.
Word of mouth + direct outreach = achievable.
